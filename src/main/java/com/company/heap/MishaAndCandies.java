/**
 * Misha and Candies
 * <p>
 * Problem Description
 * Misha loves eating candies. She has been given N boxes of Candies.
 * <p>
 * She decides that every time she will choose a box having the minimum number of candies, eat half of the candies and put the remaining candies
 * in the other box that has the minimum number of candies.
 * Misha does not like a box if it has the number of candies greater than B so she won't eat from that box. Can you find how many candies she will eat?
 * <p>
 * NOTE 1: If a box has an odd number of candies then Misha will eat the floor(odd / 2).
 * <p>
 * NOTE 2: The same box will not be chosen again.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 105
 * <p>
 * 1 <= A[i] <= 105
 * <p>
 * 1 <= B <= 106
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * The first argument is A an Array of Integers, where A[i] is the number of candies in the ith box.
 * The second argument is B, the maximum number of candies Misha like in a box.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * Return an integer denoting the number of candies Misha will eat.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 * <p>
 * A = [3, 2, 3]
 * B = 4
 * Input 2:
 * <p>
 * A = [1, 2, 1]
 * B = 2
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 * <p>
 * 2
 * Output 2:
 * <p>
 * 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 * <p>
 * 1st time Misha will eat from 2nd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 1 candy in the 1st box.
 * 2nd time she will eat from the 3rd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 2 candies in the 1st box.
 * She will not eat from the 3rd box as now it has candies greater than B.
 * So the number of candies Misha eat is 2.
 * Explanation 2:
 * <p>
 * 1st time Misha will eat from 1st box, i.e she can't eat any and will put the remaining 1 candy in the 3rd box.
 * 2nd time she will eat from the 3rd box, i.e 1 candy she'll eat and will put the remaining 1 candies in the 2nd box.
 * She will not eat from the 2nd box as now it has candies greater than B.
 * So the number of candies Misha eat is 1.
